This is unofficial implemtation of the paper "Single-Shot Motion Completion with Transformer". Some codes are adapted from the https://github.com/liangx66/Motion_InBetweening. Here we supplement evalutation metrics and refine training process. 

# Training

```python train_gobal.py```

In each epoch, we continue to iterate over each batch 5 times.
